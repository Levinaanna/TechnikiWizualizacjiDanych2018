      <h3>Does BMI make sense for dragons?</h2>
      <p>
        People tend to care about their weight. Especially after the Christmas time when we recklessly devour unprecedented amount of food just to meet new year with a resolution to finally lose weight.

        If we were dinosaurs we shouldn't worry that much. It turns out that their BMI is extremely low (kinda not surprising considering the fact that many of them are considered to have been vegetarians - becoming one is a popular resolution too). Another question popped up in my mind - being obese is connected with health risks such us diabetes, sleep apnea, not to mention osteoarthritis. Does this mean that dinosaurs with high BMI had shorter lives?

        There's definitely something to it. I encourage you to play with the plot above and see for yourself. Apart from spotting that high BMI indicates dying young (hopefully we can call 2000-year-old dinosaur young, right?) one can see that extraordinarily long living creatures had BMI in range 5 to 7 - neither too low nor too high.
